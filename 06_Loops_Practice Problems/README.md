## üìù Problem Categories

- **Number Series:** Arithmetic and geometric progressions, Fibonacci, custom series
- **Digit Operations:** Sum, count, even/odd digits, reverse, palindrome
- **Prime & Composite:** Prime checks, printing primes, composite detection
- **Special Numbers:** Armstrong, factorial, raised to power
