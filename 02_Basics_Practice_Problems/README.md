## üñ•Ô∏è Practice Problem Examples

### 1. Area of a Circle

```c
float radius = 5.0;
float area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
printf("Area: %.2f\n", area);
```

### 2. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion

```c
float celsius = 25.0;
float fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
printf("Fahrenheit: %.2f\n", fahrenheit);
```

### 3. Simple Interest Calculation

```c
float principal = 1000, rate = 5, time = 2;
float si = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
printf("Simple Interest: %.2f\n", si);
```

### 4. Remainder Without Modulus

```c
int num = 17, divisor = 5;
int quotient = num / divisor;
int remainder = num - (quotient * divisor);
printf("Remainder: %d\n", remainder);
```

### 5. Input and Output

```c
int n;
printf("Enter a number: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
printf("You entered: %d\n", n);
```
