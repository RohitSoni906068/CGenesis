# Loops in C Programming

Welcome to the **Loops** module of _The Ultimate C Programming Language_ course! This folder contains essential resources, code examples, and practice problems to help you master loops in C.

## 📚 What Are Loops?

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, making your programs efficient and concise. C provides several types of loops, each suited for different scenarios.

---

## 🔄 Types of Loops

### 1. `for` Loop

- **Use when:** The number of iterations is known.
- **Syntax:**

  ```c
  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
      // Code to execute
  }
  ```

- **Example:**

  ```c
  for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
      printf("%d ", i);
  }
  ```

### 2. `while` Loop

- **Use when:** The number of iterations is unknown; condition is checked before each iteration.
- **Syntax:**

  ```c
  while (condition) {
      // Code to execute
  }
  ```

- **Example:**

  ```c
  int i = 1;
  while (i <= 5) {
      printf("%d\n", i);
      i++;
  }
  ```

### 3. `do-while` Loop

- **Use when:** The loop body must execute at least once; condition is checked after each iteration.
- **Syntax:**

  ```c
  do {
      // Code to execute
  } while (condition);
  ```

- **Example:**

  ```c
  int i = 1;
  do {
      printf("i = %d\n", i);
      i++;
  } while (i <= 5);
  ```

### 4. Nested Loops

- **Definition:** A loop inside another loop.
- **Use for:** Pattern printing, multidimensional data, etc.
- **Example:**

  ```c
  for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
          printf("*");
      }
      printf("\n");
  }
  ```

## 🛑 Loop Control Statements

- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.
- **Infinite Loops**: Loops that never terminate (e.g., `while(1) {}` or `for(;;) {}`), usually used for special cases.

---

## 📝 Practice Problems

- **Basic Loop Exercises:**
  - Print numbers, calculate factorial, Fibonacci series, check for prime, palindrome, Armstrong numbers, etc.
  - Work with arithmetic and geometric progressions.
  - Sum and count digits, print tables, and more.
- **Pattern Printing (Nested Loops):**
  - Print various star, number, and alphabet patterns.
  - Practice creative logic with nested loops.
