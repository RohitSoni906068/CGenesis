# Conditionals & Decision Making in C

Welcome to the **If-Else & Conditionals** module of _The Ultimate C Programming Language_ course! This folder contains essential resources, code examples, and practice problems to help you master decision-making in C.

## üìö What Are Conditionals?

Conditionals allow your program to make decisions and execute different code paths based on logic and user input. Mastering these constructs is crucial for writing flexible, robust, and intelligent programs.

---

## üß© Core Concepts Covered

- **If Statements:** Basic one-way decisions
- **If-Else Statements:** Two-way branching
- **Else-If Chains:** Multi-way branching for complex logic
- **Nested Ifs:** Layered decision making
- **Switch Statements:** Clean multi-branch selection
- **Logical Operators:** AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`), equality (`==`)
- **Ternary Operator:** Concise, inline decisions
- **Truthiness in C:** How 0 and non-zero values are treated in conditions

## üñ•Ô∏è Examples

### 1. Simple `if` Statement

```c
int number = 5;
if (number > 0) {
    printf("Number is positive.\n");
}
```

### 2. `if-else` Statement

```c
int number = -3;
if (number >= 0) {
    printf("Non-negative number.\n");
} else {
    printf("Negative number.\n");
}
```

### 3. `if-else-if-else` Ladder

```c
int marks = 85;
if (marks >= 90) {
    printf("Excellent\n");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
    printf("Very Good\n");
} else if (marks >= 60) {
    printf("Good\n");
} else {
    printf("Needs Improvement\n");
}
```

### 4. Nested `if` Statements

```c
int age = 20, hasLicense = 1;
if (age >= 18) {
    if (hasLicense) {
        printf("You can drive.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Get a license first.\n");
    }
} else {
    printf("Too young to drive.\n");
}
```

### 5. `switch` Statement

```c
char grade = 'B';
switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        printf("Excellent!\n");
        break;
    case 'B':
        printf("Well done!\n");
        break;
    case 'C':
        printf("Good\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Keep trying!\n");
}
```

### 6. Logical Operators

```c
int age = 22, marks = 80;
if (age > 18 && marks > 75) {
    printf("Eligible for scholarship.\n");
}
```

### 7. Ternary Operator

```c
int num = 10;
printf("%s\n", (num % 2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd");
```

## üèÜ Best Practices for Mastering Conditionals

- **Plan Your Logic:** Use flowcharts or pseudocode for complex decisions.
- **Use Indentation & Braces:** Keep your code readable and avoid logic errors.
- **Test All Branches:** Check edge cases and all possible paths.
- **Comment Your Logic:** Explain tricky or nested conditions for clarity.
- **Prefer Switch for Multi-Way Branching:** When checking a variable against many constant values.
- **Use Ternary for Simplicity:** For concise, single-line decisions.
- **Stay Organized:** Use meaningful file and variable names.

## üí° Tips for Learners

- Start with simple if-else problems, then progress to nested and chained conditions.
- Practice converting real-world scenarios into code logic.
- Experiment with logical operators to combine multiple conditions.
- Review and solve the practice questions for mastery.
- Debug by printing variable values and condition results.
