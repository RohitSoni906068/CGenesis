## 🏁 Quick Start

1. **Browse the code examples** below to see how each type of conditional works.
2. **Run and modify** the code to deepen your understanding.
3. **Tackle the practice questions** to test your logic and creativity.

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- Writing simple and compound `if` statements
- Using `if-else` and `if-else-if` ladders for multi-way decisions
- Nesting conditionals for complex logic
- Applying logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`, `==`)
- Leveraging `switch` statements for clean multi-branch code
- Using the ternary operator for concise decisions
- Understanding how C treats 0 and non-zero values in conditions

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

- **Start simple:** Focus on one concept at a time.
- **Experiment:** Change values, add new branches, and see what happens.
- **Comment your code:** Explain your logic for future reference.
- **Debug actively:** Use print statements to trace your program's flow.
- **Refactor:** Try different approaches (e.g., switch vs. if-else).
- **Stay organized:** Keep your files tidy and well-named.
- **Ask for feedback:** Share your code with others to learn more.
