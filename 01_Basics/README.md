# C Programming: Fundamentals & Basics

Welcome to the **C Programming: Basics** module of _The Ultimate C Programming Language_ course! This folder contains essential resources, code examples, and practice questions to help you build a strong foundation in C programming.

## üìö What Are C Basics?

The basics of C programming introduce you to the building blocks of the language. Mastering these concepts is crucial for writing efficient, readable, and error-free code.

---

## üß© Core Concepts Covered

- **Program Structure:** Boilerplate code, main function, and syntax
- **Input/Output:** Using `scanf` and `printf` for user interaction
- **Comments:** Writing clear single-line and multi-line comments
- **Data Types:** Understanding `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, etc.
- **Variable Declaration:** Declaring and initializing variables
- **Variable Naming Rules:** Best practices for naming variables
- **Type Casting:** Implicit and explicit conversions
- **Escape Sequences:** Formatting output with special characters
- **Size of Data Types:** Using `sizeof` to determine memory usage
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, modulus, precedence, and associativity

## üñ•Ô∏è C Basics Examples

### 1. Boilerplate Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. Input and Output

```c
int num;
printf("Enter a number: ");
scanf("%d", &num);
printf("You entered: %d\n", num);
```

### 3. Variable Declaration and Initialization

```c
int a = 5;
float b = 3.14;
char c = 'A';
```

### 4. Type Casting

```c
int x = 10;
double y = (double)x / 3;
printf("%f\n", y); // Output: 3.333333
```

### 5. Arithmetic and Modulus Operators

```c
int sum = 7 + 3;
int mod = 7 % 3;
printf("Sum: %d, Modulus: %d\n", sum, mod);
```

### 6. Comments

```c
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
```

### 7. Escape Sequences

```c
printf("Hello\nWorld\t2024\n");
```
