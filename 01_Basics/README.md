## Boilerplate Code

Basic structure of a C program, including `main()` function, header files, and syntax essentials.

## 🔡 Input/Output

How to take input from the user and display output using functions like `scanf` and `printf`.

## 💬 Comments

Usage of single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments to document code.

## 🔢 Data Types

Overview of fundamental data types in C (int, float, char, double, etc.) and their usage.

## 📦 Variable Declaration

How to declare and initialize variables in C, including scope and lifetime.

## 🏷️ Variable Naming Rules

Rules and best practices for naming variables (allowed characters, reserved words, case sensitivity, etc.).

## 🔄 Type Casting

Converting one data type to another (implicit and explicit casting) and its importance in C.

## ⏎ Escape Sequences

Special character sequences (like `\n`, `\t`, etc.) used in strings for formatting output.

## 📏 Size of Data Types

Understanding the memory size (in bytes) of different data types using the `sizeof` operator.

## ➕ Operators

### ➗ Arithmetic (Modulus) Operator

Usage of arithmetic operators, especially the modulus operator (`%`) to find remainders.

### ⚖️ Hierarchy of Operators

Precedence and associativity of operators in C, and how expressions are evaluated.

## Solved Questions

The [`Solved_Questions/`](https://github.com/rohit528590/The-Ultimate-C-Programming-Language/tree/main/02_Basics_Practice_Problems) folder contains practical problems and their solutions, such as:

- 🟠 Area and perimeter calculations (circle, rectangle, square)
- 🌡️ Temperature conversions (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- 💰 Simple interest and percentage calculations
- 🧪 Volume calculations (cylinder, sphere)
- ➗ Remainder calculations (with and without modulus)
- 🔢 Fractional part extraction, cube, half of a number, and more

Each problem is implemented in its own file under the `Solved_Questions/` directory.
