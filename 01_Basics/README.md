# üß† Complete C Programming: Basics

Welcome to the **Complete C Programming: Basics** repository! This resource is designed for anyone starting their journey with the C programming language. It contains well-organized code examples, solved questions, and practice problems to help you master the fundamentals of C.

## üìå Core Intent

- To provide a hands-on, example-driven introduction to C programming.
- To help beginners understand foundational concepts through simple, clear code samples.
- To serve as a reference for basic C syntax, data types, operators, and common programming patterns.
- To offer solved questions and practice problems for self-assessment and learning reinforcement.

## What You Will Learn

This repository covers the following essential topics in C programming:

- **Boilerplate Code**: Structure of a basic C program, including `main()` function and header files.
- **Input/Output**: Reading from and writing to the console using `scanf` and `printf`.
- **Comments**: How to document your code with single-line and multi-line comments.
- **Data Types**: Understanding different data types in C (int, float, char, double, etc.).
- **Variable Declaration**: Declaring and initializing variables, including scope and lifetime.
- **Variable Naming Rules**: Rules and conventions for naming variables.
- **Type Casting**: Converting between data types (implicit and explicit).
- **Escape Sequences**: Special characters in C strings for formatting output.
- **Size of Data Types**: Memory size of different data types using the `sizeof` operator.
- **Operators**:
  - Arithmetic Operators (including modulus `%`)
  - Operator Hierarchy (precedence and associativity)

## Boilerplate Code

Basic structure of a C program, including `main()` function, header files, and syntax essentials.

## Input/Output

How to take input from the user and display output using functions like `scanf` and `printf`.

## Comments

Usage of single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments to document code.

## Data Types

Overview of fundamental data types in C (int, float, char, double, etc.) and their usage.

## Variable Declaration

How to declare and initialize variables in C, including scope and lifetime.

## Variable Naming Rules

Rules and best practices for naming variables (allowed characters, reserved words, case sensitivity, etc.).

## Type Casting

Converting one data type to another (implicit and explicit casting) and its importance in C.

## Escape Sequences

Special character sequences (like `\n`, `\t`, etc.) used in strings for formatting output.

## Size of Data Types

Understanding the memory size (in bytes) of different data types using the `sizeof` operator.

## Operators

### Arithmetic (Modulus) Operator

Usage of arithmetic operators, especially the modulus operator (`%`) to find remainders.

### Hierarchy of Operators

Precedence and associativity of operators in C, and how expressions are evaluated.

## Solved Questions

The `Solved_Questions/` folder contains practical problems and their solutions, such as:

- Area and perimeter calculations (circle, rectangle, square)
- Temperature conversions (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- Simple interest and percentage calculations
- Volume calculations (cylinder, sphere)
- Remainder calculations (with and without modulus)
- Fractional part extraction, cube, half of a number, and more

Each problem is implemented in its own file under the `Solved_Questions/` directory.

## Practice Questions

A set of additional C programming questions is provided in `Practice_Questions.txt` to test your understanding and help you practice writing C code on your own.
