# Exploring C Programming from Scratch

Welcome to [**The Foundation of My Programming Path!**](https://github.com/rohit528590/Complete-C-Language.git)

This repository marks the beginning of my programming journey, with C as my first language. Here, I explore core concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and more. From writing simple programs to building logic-driven solutions, this project documents my growth from a beginner to an advanced C programmer. It’s a foundation for my future in computer science and software development.

## Introduction

Welcome to my C programming repository!

As a passionate student exploring the world of computer science, I chose C as my first programming language to build a strong foundation in logic, memory management, and problem-solving. This repository reflects my journey — starting from the very basics like “Hello, World!” to more advanced concepts such as pointers, structures, file handling, and algorithmic thinking.

Through consistent practice and learning, I’ve documented my progress, challenges, and the programs I’ve written along the way. This is not just a collection of code, but a representation of my growth as a future software engineer.
