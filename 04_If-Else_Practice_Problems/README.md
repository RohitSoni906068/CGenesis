# üß© If-Else Practice Problems in C

Welcome to the **If-Else Practice Problems** module of _The Ultimate C Programming Language_ course! Here, you'll find a collection of real-world coding challenges designed to help you master conditional logic in C. Each problem is a chance to sharpen your thinking, boost your confidence, and have fun with code.

## üåü Why Practice Matters

Solving these problems will help you:

- Break down complex tasks into simple steps
- Think like a programmer
- Get comfortable with `if`, `else if`, `else`, and logical operators

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, this folder is your launchpad for logical thinking!

## üñ•Ô∏è Conditional Practice Examples

### 1. Find Minimum of Two Numbers

```c
int a = 5, b = 8;
printf("Min: %d\n", (a < b) ? a : b);
```

### 2. Divisibility by 5 or 3 but Not 15

```c
int n = 30;
if (((n % 5 == 0) || (n % 3 == 0)) && (n % 15 != 0)) {
    printf("Yes\n");
} else {
    printf("No\n");
}
```

### 3. Pass/Fail Based on Marks

```c
int marks = 42;
if (marks >= 33) {
    printf("Passed\n");
} else {
    printf("Failed\n");
}
```

### 4. Grading System

```c
int marks = 85;
if (marks >= 90) printf("A+\n");
else if (marks >= 80) printf("A\n");
else if (marks >= 70) printf("B\n");
else printf("C or below\n");
```

### 5. Leap Year Check

```c
int year = 2024;
if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
    printf("Leap Year\n");
} else {
    printf("Not Leap Year\n");
}
```

### 6. Profit or Loss

```c
int cp = 100, sp = 120;
if (sp > cp) printf("Profit: %d\n", sp - cp);
else if (cp > sp) printf("Loss: %d\n", cp - sp);
else printf("No profit, no loss\n");
```
