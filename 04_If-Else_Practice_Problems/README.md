## 💡 How to Get the Most Out of This Folder

- **Start simple:** Pick any problem and read the description.
- **Write your own code:** Try to solve it before peeking at the solution.
- **Experiment:** Change the numbers, add new conditions, or rewrite the logic.
- **Comment your code:** Explain your thinking in your own words.
- **Debug:** If something doesn’t work, use print statements to trace your logic.
- **Reflect:** After solving, ask yourself: How else could I solve this?
- **Share:** Discuss your solutions with friends or online communities.
